			<Page>Oh yeah, those things wanted you to find the black hole so they could explore space before everything goes kablooie.</Page>
			<Page>One of 'em said they could read your memories, or something. So they try to follow in your footsteps every loop to explore what they can before the loop occurs.</Page>
			<Page>I guess that means they end up exploring the universe kinda like you. Or something. But I digress...</Page>

			<Page>Anyways, some guy told me to tell you something, but I forgot what it was.</Page>
			<Page>It was something like "Thanks for playing!" or something like that. Or maybe it was something about this being made in only a week for a modding jam?</Page>
			<Page>I can't remember, they didn't pay me back those fifty Hearthian coins they owe me.</Page>
			<Page>But anyways, you can go back to the "surface" with that black hole over there. But that's all.</Page>
